# Turmeric Guard: AI-enabled Early Detection and Farmer Alert System for Rhizome Rot Disease

## Project Overview
"Turmeric Guard" is an AI-enabled system designed for the early detection of rhizome rot disease in turmeric plants. This system aims to assist farmers by providing timely alerts and actionable information, ultimately helping to prevent crop loss and improve yield. This project was undertaken as part of a two-month internship program at Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences.

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Turmeric Guard" project, developed to detect rhizome rot disease in turmeric plants using machine learning techniques. The project leverages the YOLOv9 algorithm for real-time detection and a mobile application to alert farmers.

## Objectives
1. Identify factors causing rhizome rot.
2. Evaluate machine learning algorithms for classification and prediction.
3. Collect and prepare a dataset of turmeric leaf images.
4. Train a machine learning model using YOLOv9.
5. Develop a mobile application for real-time disease detection and farmer alerts.

## Work Done
- **Research**: Investigated the causes of rhizome rot disease.
- **Algorithm Evaluation**: Evaluated various machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective for our needs.
- **Data Collection**: Collected a comprehensive dataset of images featuring healthy and diseased turmeric leaves.
- **Model Training**: Trained a YOLOv9 model to detect rhizome rot disease with high accuracy.
- **Application Development**: Developed a mobile application to provide real-time detection and alert farmers.

## Results
The trained YOLOv9 model can accurately detect rhizome rot in turmeric plants. This model is integrated into a mobile application, offering a practical tool for farmers to identify the disease early and receive timely alerts.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable hands-on experience in machine learning and data preparation. It highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and significantly enhanced our technical skills.
